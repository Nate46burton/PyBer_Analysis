# Overview

The purpose of deliverable 1 was to give a summary of the total rides, total drivers, total fares per city type and then to also show the average fare per ride and per driver.

The purpose of deliverable 2 was to give a representation of the total fares by city type between January 1st and April 28th of 2019.

# Results

Deliverable 1: 
    Urban had by far the most total rides and drivers over rural and suburban. But the average fare per ride and driver was highest among rural rides. 

Deliverable 2:
    Urban had the highest total fares among the city types throughout the entire 4 month span depicted. Rural had the lowest total fares among the 3 city types throughout the entire 4 month span.
    Between February and March seemed to be when the total fares were highest among all 3 city types. 

# Summary 

Based on the results for the two deliverables conducted above, I would make the following recommendations to address the disparities among city type.

Rural had the lowest total fares but also had the highest average fare per ride. This is likely because the distance covered for rural rides is larger even if it takes similar amounts of time to get to the destination. 

Urban had the highest total rides but lowest average cost. This is likely because the distance traveled is less  than it would be in more spread out areas.

Because the disparities seem to be associated with distance traveled not time of ride. perhaps switching from a cost per distance model to a cost per time of ride model may be able to lessen the disparities between the 3 city types.
